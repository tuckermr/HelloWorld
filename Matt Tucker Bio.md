## Co-op Work Experience
I have worked/co-oped at a company called **Signalysis** since early 2013. Signalysis is a company that uses sound and vibration testing to verify the integrity of mechanical parts. I started at Signalysis knowing very litle about programming and essentially learned to code while working there. I coded mostly in C++ but also gained experience in C#, Java, Python and LabVIEW. I gained experience with the entire development process from writing specifications to fully testing the software. 

## Project Sought
I have always wanted to make a video game of some sort. I have dabbled with game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine 3/4, but never created a fininshed project.
