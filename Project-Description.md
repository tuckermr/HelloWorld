Project Description: Create a game that eliminates the line between work and play and teaches programming in a fun interactable enivornment. Aimed towards younger students with no programming experience

Project problem statement: The world needs more programmers and we need the learning process to be less daunting and more welcoming.

Inadequacy of current solutions to problem: Current solutions only are typically very specific and hard for young, inexperienced students to understand. This solution will take a much simpler approach to teaching the concepts.

Background skills/interests applicable to problem: 

Matt Tucker: Video game fan, Unity and Unreal Engine 3/4 experience, C++, some C#/Java/Python

Overall goals/expectations: We plan to have a working game that effectively teaches programming in a fun environment. One of our main goals is to have a game that is entertaining in it's own right so the player learns aspects of programming while enjoying their time.
